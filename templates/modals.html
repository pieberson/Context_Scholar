        <p>Our mission is to revolutionize academic discovery by prioritizing both relevance and fairness in scholarly search. We recognize that traditional academic search engines often favor highly cited papers, which can perpetuate citation bias and limit the visibility of innovative or emerging research. By leveraging advanced semantic search technologies, we aim to surface research based on contextual meaning and true scholarly value, rather than mere popularity or citation count.</p>
        <p>We are committed to creating an inclusive and equitable platform that empowers researchers, students, and academics from diverse backgrounds to access and contribute to the global body of knowledge. Our system is designed to highlight underrepresented work, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and support open science initiatives. Through transparency, continuous improvement, and community engagement, we strive to make academic discovery more accessible, unbiased, and impactful for everyone.</p>

      <p>
        We use advanced BERT-based models to extract semantic meaning from queries and documents, enabling more accurate, context-aware academic search results. Unlike traditional keyword-based search engines, semantic search leverages deep learning to understand the intent behind your query and the nuanced content of academic papers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our system encodes both queries and documents into high-dimensional vector representations, capturing relationships, synonyms, and contextual information. This allows us to match research papers not just by exact words, but by their underlying meaning, surfacing relevant work that might otherwise be overlooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        By integrating semantic search, we help users discover interdisciplinary connections, emerging research, and diverse perspectivesâ€”making academic discovery more comprehensive and insightful.

<!-- Citation Bias Modal -->

    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>
        Citation bias occurs when academic search engines and recommendation systems disproportionately favor highly cited papers, often at the expense of newer or less mainstream research. This can reinforce established viewpoints, limit exposure to innovative ideas, and perpetuate systemic inequities in scholarly visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our platform actively mitigates citation bias by integrating fairness-aware re-ranking algorithms into the search process. Instead of ranking results solely by citation count or popularity, we evaluate papers based on their semantic relevance, contextual value, and contribution to diverse perspectives. This approach ensures that high-quality but less-cited research is surfaced alongside well-known works, giving users a more balanced and comprehensive view of the academic landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        By promoting equitable representation in search results, we empower researchers to discover emerging topics, underrepresented voices, and interdisciplinary connections that might otherwise be overlooked. Our commitment to transparency and continuous improvement means we regularly assess and refine our methods to further reduce bias and support a fairer, more inclusive academic ecosystem.
